# Lyrics-Finder-App

Hey programmers, This is a basic lyrics app which accepts Artist Name and Song Name, shows the lyrics of the Song. 
This is my first android app.

# BEHIND-THE-SCENES

Not a big app, just **JSON parser**, there is a website named **api.lyrics.ovh** where you can find the lyrics of the selected song in JSON element under the 
**lyrics** key, then **RequestQueue** and **Volley** would parse it by adding artist and song name.
